# 06-Server-Side-APIs

## Description
I was tasked in making a Weather Dashboard that will display the current and future 5 day weather conditions for whatever city the user inputs into the searchbox. It was very challenging but I learned a lot from this assignment. I used materialize instead of boostrap to learn how to use a different CSS framework. I had a very difficult time understanding why my calls werent working but after working with a Tutor, I was able call it accordinlgy so the correct information could populate when the user. In all it was a fun and challenging assignment and I had learned a ton from it.
